----

[gqlscan](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/graph-guard/gqlscan) provides functions for fast and allocation-free
lexical scanning and validation of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) queries according
to the [GraphQL specification of October 2021](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/).

The provided functions don't perform semantic analysis such as
making sure that declared variables are used or that
values match their declared types, etc. as this is outside the scope
of lexical analysis.

## Benchmark

All tests were performed on an Apple M1 Max 14" MBP running macOS Monterey 12.4.

### Benchmark Suite

The benchmark suite allows testing arbitrary query sets for throughput.

```console
go run cmd/bench/main.go -i cmd/bench/inputs
```

Single core:
```console
gathered 4 input file(s):
 inputs/complex.graphql: 2.2 kB
 inputs/longstr.graphql: 3.8 kB
 inputs/longstr_blk.graphql: 4.4 kB
 inputs/small.graphql: 28 B
running 1 parallel goroutine(s) for 1m0s
finished (1m0.000025417s)
total processed: 72 GB (1.2 GB/s; 8.96 gbit/s)
total errors: 0
```

Multicore:
```console
gathered 4 input file(s):
 inputs/complex.graphql: 2.2 kB
 inputs/longstr.graphql: 3.8 kB
 inputs/longstr_blk.graphql: 4.4 kB
 inputs/small.graphql: 28 B
running 10 parallel goroutine(s) for 1m0s
finished (1m0.000055208s)
total processed: 593 GB (9.9 GB/s; 73.66 gbit/s)
total errors: 0
```

### Test Benchmarks
